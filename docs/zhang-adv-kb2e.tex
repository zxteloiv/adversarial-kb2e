\section{Introduction}

Knowledge graph is an important component in many natural language processing applications nowadays, such as natural language inference, question answering, and task-oriented dialogue generation. One of the fundamental tasks in the field is \emph{representation learning}, which aims to learn a representation for each \emph{entity} and \emph{relation} in a knowledge graph. Consider the following example. The triple \emph{(Leonhard Euler, BornIn, Basel)} is a selected fact from a typical knowledge graph, \emph{WikiData}\footnote{https://www.wikidata.org/}. Representation learning models assign a vectorized representation respectively to the head entity \emph{Leonhard Euler} and the tail entity \emph{Basel}, and some models also give a representation for each relation namely \emph{BornIn} in this example. In general, there must be some characteristics to hold or constraints to meet for these representations, which facilitate other tasks like inference or completion on the knowledge graph.

One of the most popular constraints is the translation assumption. Borders et al.~\cite{TransE2013} first proposed the \emph{TransE} model, in which the representation of a tail entity~$(t)$ could be arithmetically computed by adding the representations of the corresponding head entity~$(h)$ and relation~$(r)$, that is, $h + r \simeq t$. This gives a very concise and beautiful geometric explanation that every relation can move or \emph{translate} an entity embedding into another, and hence its name \emph{TransE}. Specifically, they try to minimize a hinge loss with a predefined margin as follows,
\[
    \min\sum_{\substack{(h, r, t)\in S,\\ (h^\prime, r, t^\prime)\in S^\prime }}
        {\left[\gamma + f(h, r, t) - f(h^\prime, r, t^\prime)\right]}_+,
\]
where $S$ is the set of triples and $S'$ is the set of negative samples. $f(h, r, t)$ can be viewed as an energy or scoring function which in their case is an L1 or L2 norm of $h + r - t$.

The training method above shares the same basic framework with many other work. For instance, \emph{TransR}~\cite{TransR2015} introduces a mapping from the entity space to the relation space, where the scoring functions is $\parallel h M_r + r - t M_r \parallel_2^2 $, and \emph{Neural Tensor Network} (NTN)~\cite{NTN} utilizes a bilinear model and a single layer neural network to achieve impressive results, whose scoring function is $u_r^T \tanh(h^T W_r^{[1:k]}t + V_r[h;t] + b_r)$. The training framework can be viewed as a discriminative model because the key scoring function aims to predict high scores for real possible facts in a knowledge graph while lowers the scores for the sampled negative facts, thus we may expect it to give a reasonable high score for some missing but possible facts at testing time.

On the contrary, there are also generative approaches to model the knowledge graph. It's usually easier for generative models to do semi-supervised learning and anomaly detection. With the revival of neural networks and deep learning, the GAN~\cite{GAN} exploits the high fitting power of neural networks to train a generator alternatively with a discriminator model.
